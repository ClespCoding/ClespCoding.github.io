                <p>The North Sea Empire, also known as the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire, was the thalassocratic domain ruled by Cnut the Great as King of England, Denmark, and Norway in the early 11th century.</p>
                
                <h3>Rise of Cnut the Great</h3>
                <p>Cnut was the son of Sweyn Forkbeard, king of Denmark. Following his father's death in 1014, Cnut embarked on a campaign to conquer England, which culminated in his coronation in 1016. By 1028, he had also secured the Norwegian crown, thus creating a powerful maritime empire around the North Sea.</p>
                
                <h3>Political Structure</h3>
                <p>Rather than rule as a unified empire with centralized governance, Cnut maintained separate administrations for each kingdom. In England, he divided the realm into four earldoms: Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia, and Northumbria. This system allowed local customs and laws to continue while still ensuring Cnut's ultimate authority.</p>
                
                <h3>Trade and Cultural Exchange</h3>
                <p>The unification of these North Sea territories under one ruler facilitated increased trade and cultural exchange throughout the region. Archaeological evidence shows an increase in trade goods moving between Scandinavia and England during this period, including pottery, jewelry, and luxury items.</p>
                
                <h3>Legacy</h3>
                <p>Though the North Sea Empire disintegrated after Cnut's death in 1035, its influence on the political and cultural development of Northern Europe was profound. The connections established during this period laid groundwork for future trade networks that would eventually evolve into the Hanseatic League.</p>
